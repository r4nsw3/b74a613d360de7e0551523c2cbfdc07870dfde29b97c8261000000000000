  |   War rages on. During an air raid, 16 year old Noah and his little     |
  |   sister Renie seek shelter in a bunker. There, not only are they       |
  |   protected from the deadly bombardment, but are also at the            |
  |   crossroads of a world between life and death: Silence. When Noah's    |
  |   sister gets lost in Silence, he is forced to venture into this        |
  |   idyllic yet threatening world to find her.                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Silence, however, bears its own scars of war and suffering. Dark      |
  |   creatures haunt towns and cities and ravage this once serene place    |
  |   between worlds. Only a small band of rebels stands against the        |
  |   looming menace. Now it is up to the siblings to save Silence and      |
  |   its fantastic inhabitants from impending doom and thus also save      |
  |   their own lives.                                                      |

  |   Join Noah and Renie on their exciting journey through Silence where   |
  |   an emotionally gripping story of contrasts between serenity and       |
  |   danger unfolds. Meet fascinating and likeable characters like Spot,   |
  |   the magical caterpillar who helps Noah and Renie on their way         |
  |   through Silence. And witness when the siblings discover that the      |
  |   only thing that can save them is their love for each other.           |
